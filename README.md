# lc3-typescript-vm

An LC3 VM in typescript.

Inspired by https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html and tried to port this to nodejs/typescript.

I've included https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048 as a sample program that's already assembled to run.

Eventually I'd like to try and get this running in the browser.
